# Ideas
- Add usernames for actions
- Add emoji in status bar for people who reviewed instead of counts
- Time to review AVG
- Daily reminders of PR to review (per squad :( / channels)

# To refactor
- Slub/Infrastructure/Chat/Slack/SlubBot.php:77 - To rework PRIdentifier should be created with "repository" and "PRNumber" to create the PRIdentifier
- config/services.yaml:19 - set public classes to false: the "test" env should have public true (unless the bug has been fixed)
- Remove filebased ?
- Rework the usage of guzzle mocks + setups in one class common place
- /!\ Remove GetVCSStatus dependency in the putToReviewHandler -> get the information before creating the command
- /!\ There is something fishy going on with the PRIdentifier
- Rework Update CI status command with custom setters
- The application layer should not be responsible for the formatting nor the content of messages (see application/notify)
